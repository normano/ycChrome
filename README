ExContent Recommender for Google Chrome

The ExContent Recommender uses a variant of the naive bayes classifier for classification of interesting and not interesting posts. It highlights the ones that were highlighted as interesting. In other words, it attempts to predict what you like based on articles you clicked. If you'd like to learn more visit http://normansoven.com/blog/?p=651

How to use:
If you currently have the extension installed, remove it.
1. On the extensions page, check developer mode if you haven't already.
2. Click Load unpacked extension and go to the folder that contains the source code.
Done, simple as pie!.

Whenever you make changes to your version of the extension, while on the extensions page click reload under the extension.

Hope this helps!
